## Support Style 💬

As a teammate, I aim to be:

- A cheerleader who brings quiet clarity, not chaos  
- A fixer of tangled processes, unclear comms, or onboarding woes  
- Someone who will ask, “Want help thinking this through?”  
- A low-key team culture spark — whether it’s a GIF battle, a lighthearted prompt, or a tiny celebration, I believe joy and fun are powerful ways to build trust  
- I care deeply about creating a team environment where **care, connection, and psychological safety** go hand in hand
