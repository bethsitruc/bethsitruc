# Hi there 👋
## 👩‍🦰 About Me

I’m a passionate technical leader with a strong background in project management, engineering training, and software development. My expertise lies in managing teams, fostering collaboration, and creating impactful learning experiences that empower engineers to grow in their careers. With experience spanning technical training, agile methodologies, and business continuity planning, I thrive in roles that bridge technology and education.

Currently, I lead engineering onboarding and training programs at GitHub, ensuring new engineers have the tools and support they need to succeed. Throughout my career, I’ve managed cross-functional teams, implemented CI/CD best practices, and facilitated technical content development. I believe in the power of mentorship, continuous learning, and technology’s ability to drive meaningful change.

When I’m not working, you’ll find me baking new treats, keeping up with my four kids, or exploring Raleigh—my home since 2015!
