# Bethany Curtis – Manager README

_A guide to how I show up as a manager, what I value, and how we can do great work together._

---

## TL;DR
Hi! I’m Bethany — a steady, supportive leader who believes great management starts with empathy, clarity, and trust. I care deeply about building strong teams, improving processes, and creating a space where people can grow and thrive. And yes, I love a good cup of coffee — preferably during a meaningful 1:1 or team brainstorm.

---

## Why This Exists
- To set expectations clearly and kindly, so we can work well together
- To help you understand how I operate as a manager — what I value, what I’m working on, and how I’ll support you
- To give you a few shortcuts to getting the best out of our working relationship

## What This Is Not
- A fixed snapshot of who I’ll always be — I’m growing, evolving, and adjusting as I learn
- A substitute for real conversation or feedback — please talk to me
- A way to avoid accountability — I’ll always do my best to show up and earn your trust

---

## What I Value
- **Kindness + Clarity**: You can say almost anything if it’s said with respect and purpose
- **Connection + Community**: I’m always on the lookout for fun, low-pressure ways to build team spirit — games, shared moments, and inside jokes matter more than you think
- **People Over Ego**: We are here to build something together — no one has to go it alone
- **Growth Mindset**: I don’t expect perfection, but I do expect progress and openness to learning
- **Thoughtful Change**: I love improving processes, but I believe change should be intentional and inclusive

---

## What You Can Expect from Me
- I will advocate for you and support your goals, inside and outside of work
- I will check in regularly, not just about projects, but about *you*
- I will give feedback with care and clarity — and I’ll ask for it in return
- I will work hard to remove blockers and give you space to do your best work
- I will celebrate your wins and help you grow from setbacks

---

## What I Expect from You
- Be kind, curious, and accountable
- Share your ideas and your concerns — your voice matters
- Communicate early if you’re stuck or overwhelmed (I will help!)
- Ask questions, take ownership, and give feedback (to me and others)

---

## How I Like to Work
- **Communication**: Slack for quick things, shared docs for visibility, video chats for nuance
- **1:1s**: A mix of structure and open conversation — bring topics, goals, blockers, or just what’s on your mind
- **Feedback**: I prefer a heads-up if something’s not working. Assume positive intent and I’ll always listen
- **Decision-making**: I like context, thoughtfulness, and options. I rarely say “no” without explanation
- **My Style**: Supportive first. I’ll guide, coach, and collaborate — not micromanage

---

## Things I’m Still Working On
- Delegating more and sooner — I sometimes default to “I’ll just take care of it”
- Surfacing praise more publicly (I often assume people *know* I appreciate them — but I can do better about *saying* it)
- Navigating conflict more directly — I aim to balance honesty with empathy, and I’m always improving

---

## If We Work Together...
Let’s build trust through transparency, mutual support, and a shared sense of purpose. I will do everything I can to make this a place where you feel heard, challenged, and safe to be your full self.

And if I ever fall short, I hope you’ll feel comfortable letting me know. We’ll grow better — together.
