# Bethany Curtis – Manager README  
*A guide to how I show up as a manager, what I value, and how we can do great work together.*

---

## TL;DR  
Hi! I’m Bethany — a steady, supportive leader who believes great management starts with empathy, clarity, and trust. I care deeply about building strong teams, improving processes, and creating a space where people can grow and thrive. And yes, I love a good cup of coffee — preferably during a meaningful 1:1 or a collaborative team brainstorm ☕.

---

## Why This Exists

- To set expectations clearly and kindly, so we can work well together  
- To help you understand how I operate — what I value, what I’m working on, and how I’ll support you  
- To give you a few shortcuts to get the best out of our working relationship  

---

## What This Is Not

- A fixed snapshot — I’m still growing and learning  
- A substitute for real conversations — please talk to me  
- A way to avoid accountability — I’ll always do my best to earn your trust  

---

## What I Value

- **Kindness + Clarity:** Say what you mean, kindly and clearly  
- **Connection + Community:** Trust is built through shared joy *and* steady support — expect GIF battles, inside jokes, and thoughtful 1:1s  
- **People Over Ego:** No heroes here — we do better when we do it together  
- **Growth Mindset:** Progress > perfection. Let’s learn and level up  
- **Thoughtful Change:** Improvement is always welcome — but it should be collaborative, not chaotic  

---

## What You Can Expect from Me

- 💬 Regular check-ins — about work *and* how you're doing  
- ✅ Feedback that's clear, actionable, and rooted in care  
- 🎯 Support for your goals — inside and outside of your role  
- 🧱 Blocker removal so you can focus on what matters  
- 🎉 Celebrating your wins (even the tiny ones)

---

## What I Hope for From You

- Be kind, curious, and accountable  
- Speak up — your voice matters, your ideas are valuable  
- Tell me when you're stuck or overwhelmed — I want to help  
- Ask questions, own your work, and give feedback (to me too!)

## How I Like to Work

| Topic              | My Preference                                                  |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Communication** | Slack for quick async, shared docs for visibility, video for nuance  
| **1:1s**           | A mix of structure + openness — goals, blockers, random life updates welcome  
| **Feedback**       | Direct is great — just give me a heads-up when possible  
| **Decision-Making**| I like context, options, and collaboration — I rarely say “no” without explaining  
| **My Style**       | I lead with support — I’ll coach, guide, and clear the path (not micromanage)

---

## Things I’m Still Working On

- **Delegating early:** I tend to default to “I’ll just do it”  
- **Praising more publicly:** You might *feel* appreciated — I want to make sure you *hear* it  
- **Navigating conflict:** Still learning to surface hard things kindly but directly

---

## If We Work Together...

Let’s build a team where we:
- Feel safe to speak up, mess up, and grow  
- Celebrate each other’s progress  
- Infuse work with purpose *and* play  
- Show up with curiosity, clarity, and care  

If I ever fall short, I hope you’ll feel comfortable letting me know. We’ll grow better — together 💛
