## TL;DR  
Hi! I’m Bethany — a supportive teammate who loves clean processes, quiet focus time, and moments of genuine connection. I care deeply about doing meaningful work *well* and helping others do the same (preferably over coffee and with a sense of humor).

## This Guide Exists Because...  
- Working together is easier when we don’t have to guess what makes each other tick  
- I believe in setting the tone for clear, kind collaboration  
- A little self-awareness can go a long way — so consider this a user manual, not a disclaimer

---

## But Just So We’re Clear...  
- This isn’t set in stone — I’m still growing and learning as I go  
- It doesn’t mean I won’t mess up or get stuck sometimes — just that I care enough to try to do better  
- It’s not a replacement for real, human interaction — come talk to me; I promise I’m nicer than this doc

## About Me

### How would your best teammates describe working with you?
I’m a natural supporter. I’m at my best when I can jump behind someone else’s vision and help make it happen. While I *can* take the lead, I prefer to uplift others, encourage them, and be a steady presence they can count on. I’m the kind of teammate people feel comfortable opening up to — especially when something’s bothering them — and I genuinely want to help make things better.

### When do you feel most energized at work?
Give me a process that needs cleaning up (bonus points if there’s code involved), and I’m in my zone. I love simplifying complex things and transforming wall-of-text chaos into clean, easy-to-follow content. I also really value deep focus time — but I won’t turn down a good team chat or a morale-boosting game. Just please don’t make me join a 5-minute meeting that could’ve been a Slack thread.

### What’s your default reaction to stress or tight deadlines?
Tight deadline? Let’s go. I love proving I can knock something out quickly. But stress from conflict or tension? That’s trickier — I tend to absorb it, not confront it. I’ll still try to make things better, just probably not by wading into an argument.

### What do you wish you were better at, and how are you working on it?
I wish I were more detailed in the moment — like commenting my code as I write, not as a post-project scavenger hunt. I’m also aspiring to become the kind of note taker who emerges from meetings with actionable gems instead of vague bullet points. And I’m working on sharpening my judgment about which items actually need action (versus just being interesting noise).

### Do you tend to overthink or move fast? How do you balance that?
Both. I move fast on tasks because I love being productive and useful — but if something has emotional weight or involves people, I can overthink it to the moon and back. I try to balance this by staying in motion, but taking a pause when people are involved.

### Do you enjoy collaboration or prefer deep focus work? When?
Yes and yes. I love idea-sharing when the energy is right — a lively group chat, not a room of blank stares or tense disagreement. But I equally love zoning in on a solo project where I can get into the flow.

### How do you reset after a frustrating moment?
Walk away, breathe, coffee, maybe a quick game to reset my brain. I don’t like to dwell in frustration if I can help it.

## Communication & Feedback

### Do you like to chat things out or come back with thoughts later?
Definitely a “give me a minute” kind of person. I prefer to reflect and respond with something thoughtful, not react on the spot.

### Preferred tools for complex issues?
Slack first — I like space to process. But if it’s really detailed or messy, I’m all for a quick video call to untangle it live.

### How do you feel about receiving feedback unexpectedly vs. scheduled?
I appreciate a heads-up that feedback is coming — it helps me show up with a growth mindset instead of being caught off guard. I always want to improve, but I process things deeply, so I might need a little time before I can act on it.

### How do you like to give feedback?
I prefer to give feedback in a 1:1 setting where I can check in first, understand the person’s perspective, and make sure they feel safe and supported. I try to lead with empathy — everyone has off days, and I want to know the “why” before jumping into the “how to fix it.” When needed, I’ll be specific and clear, but I always aim to make it feel constructive, not critical.

### How do you like to get feedback?
I appreciate feedback that assumes positive intent. Framing it with something like, “Maybe you were trying to…” helps me stay open and reflective, instead of defensive. I don’t mind directness, but I do value kindness and curiosity in the delivery. Give me a bit of time to process it, and I’ll genuinely work on it.

## About My Colleagues

### What qualities do you particularly value in your colleagues?
I love working with team players — people who care about doing good work *together*, not just individually. I’m drawn to folks who value other people’s ideas, who bring their own ideas with clarity and context (not just volume), and who genuinely want to help others grow. Bonus points if you work hard, care about getting things right, and still make space to be kind while doing it.

### What do you wish colleagues didn’t do?
Please don’t say, “That’s how we’ve always done it.” I’m all for tradition *if* it’s still working — but let’s not use it as a shield against thoughtful improvement.

At the same time, I struggle when someone charges in ready to change everything just for the sake of shaking things up, without listening to the people those changes actually affect. I value intentional, collaborative change — not ego-driven rebrands.

I also really value competence, effort, and shared responsibility. It’s frustrating when people check out, push their work onto others, or take on everything themselves and unintentionally block team contribution. We all do better when we support one another, and that only works when people show up with accountability and openness.

### How can people earn an extra gold star with you?
Spotting a problem is helpful. Showing up with a potential solution? Chef’s kiss. I really appreciate people who take initiative with thoughtfulness, not just criticism.

I also love when teammates actively support each other’s growth — whether that’s sharing knowledge, making space to teach, or just being generous with their time. And if you’re someone who celebrates other people’s wins at work? You’ve got a gold star, a thank-you note, and probably a baked good in your future.

## About My Interactions

### How do you coach people to do their best work and develop their talents?
I aim to be a safe, approachable space — someone you can come to with concerns, ideas, or “I just need to talk this through” moments. I’m always eager to help when I know someone’s stretched thin or going through something (like family leave or personal stress).

In previous roles, I’ve stepped in to handle the quick, mundane tasks so others could focus on the bigger priorities — because to me, supporting the team means clearing the path, not just cheering from the side. I love asking guiding questions and encouraging people to run with their own ideas. I’ll outline every step if that’s what someone needs (been there, done that — parenting vibes), but I’ll also expect them to grow from it and start leading the charge themselves.

### What’s the best way to communicate with you?
Slack is great for quick, actionable things — I’ll usually respond pretty fast. But if it’s something that needs real connection, context, or nuance, a video chat works best. Sometimes a face-to-face moment (even virtual) helps more than a flurry of messages.

### What’s the best way to convince you to do something?
Show me the value — whether it’s making a process smoother or improving someone’s experience. I’m much more likely to get on board if I can see the “why” behind the idea. I don’t respond well to pressure or being rushed into a decision — I need time to process and reflect before fully committing.

### How do you like to give feedback?
I prefer to give feedback in a 1:1 setting where I can check in first, understand the person’s perspective, and make sure they feel safe and supported. I try to lead with empathy — everyone has off days, and I want to know the “why” before jumping into the “how to fix it.” When needed, I’ll be specific and clear, but I always aim to make it feel constructive, not critical.
